  summary:
    Collection and development kit of MATLAB MEX functions for OpenCV library.
  description:
    mexopencv provides MATLAB MEX functions that interface with hundreds of
    OpenCV APIs. Also the package contains a C++ class that converts between
    MATLAB's native data type and OpenCV data types. The package is suitable for
    fast prototyping of OpenCV application in MATLAB, use of OpenCV as an
    external toolbox in MATLAB, and development of custom MEX functions.
