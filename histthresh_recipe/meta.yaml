  summary: Selected histogram-based thresholding algorithms for Matlab.
  description: |
    This Matlab toolbox was originally authored by Antti Niemistö who
    released it under GPLv2+ during his PhD at Tampere University of
    Technology, Finland.

     It has been ported to ImageJ 1.X by Gabriel Landini, partially picked
     up by Wayne Rasband, and based on Gabriel's port, Barry DeZonia ported it
     to ImageJ 2 (under the 2-clause BSD license).

     There is also an Octave port, as optional argument to graythresh() in the
     image package, prepared by Carnë Draug.
